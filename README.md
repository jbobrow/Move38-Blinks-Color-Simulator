# Blinks - Color Simulator
With 6 RGB LEDs, the kinds of color fading effects for blinks will be plentiful. This tool will serve two purposes:
1. As a guide for how colors will blend, to be referenced when trying to create a specific color effect
2. As a WebGL reference for a potential simulator, if/when that becomes part of the roadmap
